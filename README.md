## Overview

This repository accompanies the paper **"Simulations of the Evolving Ozone Layer: Implications for the Early Earth and Exoplanets"** It contains the simulation data, model configuration files, and analysis scripts used to study how Earth's atmosphere — and in particular its ozone (O₃) layer — responds to changing atmospheric oxygen levels from the **Proterozoic through the Phanerozoic to the present day**.

The central scientific question is how atmospheric photochemistry and ozone evolve as O₂ rises from near-zero levels in the Proterozoic (the "faint young Sun" era) through the oxygenation events of the Phanerozoic to modern conditions. We simulate this evolution using four independent one-dimensional (1D) photochemical models, benchmarked against **WACCM6**, a configuration of the Community Earth System Model (CESM) that couples interactive chemistry with a three-dimensional general circulation model.

Across thousands of atmospheric states, we systematically vary:

1. **Atmospheric oxygenation** — O₂ boundary conditions from 0.1% to 150% of Present Atmospheric Level (PAL), spanning Proterozoic anoxia through Phanerozoic and modern oxygenation.
2. **Solar evolution** — the changing solar UV spectrum and bolometric flux from 4.0 Ga to the present day (the faint young Sun problem).
3. **Thermal structure** — pressure–temperature (P–T) profiles taken from WACCM6 for each oxygenation state, ensuring the 1D models use atmospheres consistent with 3D climate.
4. **Lower-boundary fluxes** — surface emissions of CH₄, N₂O, and related reduced gases.
5. **Water vapour** — tropospheric humidity scaling (e.g. 60% relative humidity perturbations).
6. **Surface albedo** — values from 0.06 to 0.30.
7. **Solar zenith angle (SZA)** — 45°, 48.2°, and 60°, with appropriate diurnal averaging factors.

We quantify how model choice and boundary-condition assumptions affect ozone columns, odd-oxygen budgets, and synthetic transmission/emission spectra relevant to Earth-like exoplanet observations.

## Models used

| Model | Description | Repository |
|-------|-------------|------------|
| **Atmos** | 1D photochemical–climate model from the Virtual Planetary Laboratory | [github.com/VirtualPlanetaryLaboratory/atmos](https://github.com/VirtualPlanetaryLaboratory/atmos) |
| **Photochem** | Photochemical and climate model for planetary atmospheres | [github.com/Nicholaswogan/photochem](https://github.com/Nicholaswogan/photochem) |
| **VULCAN** | Chemical kinetics code for exoplanetary and planetary atmospheres | [github.com/shami-EEG/VULCAN](https://github.com/shami-EEG/VULCAN) |
| **Kasting 1D model** | 1D photochemical model developed in the group headed by James Kasting, with correlated-*k* O₂ Schumann–Runge photolysis (Ji et al. 2024) | [zenodo.org/records/10822978](https://zenodo.org/records/10822978) |
| **WACCM6** | Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model version 6 — a configuration of CESM used as the 3D benchmark | [github.com/ESCOMP/CESM](https://github.com/ESCOMP/CESM) |

All four 1D models are run with harmonised boundary conditions where possible (matching lower-boundary mixing ratios, stellar spectra, and WACCM6 P–T profiles) so that differences in output reflect genuine model physics rather than inconsistent inputs.

## Oxygenation states

Simulations are organised by O₂ level expressed as a percentage of PAL:

| Folder name | Approx. O₂ (% PAL) |
|-------------|-------------------|
| `0.1pc` | 0.1% |
| `0.5pc` | 0.5% |
| `1pc` | 1% |
| `5pc` | 5% |
| `10pc` | 10% |
| `50pc` | 50% |
| `100pc` | 100% |
| `150pc` | 150% |

Solar-age labels such as `Sun_0.0Ga` (present Sun) and `Sun_2.4Ga` (younger Sun) indicate which stellar spectrum was used. The **Young Sun** and **Coupled Young Sun Simulations** folders explore the faint young Sun explicitly.

Output from the [Atmos](https://github.com/VirtualPlanetaryLaboratory/atmos) model. Simulations are **uncoupled** (fixed P–T profiles from WACCM6).

**Standard grid** (`0.1pc/`, `1pc/`, … `150pc/`):  
Each oxygenation folder contains sub-folders for solar zenith angle (`SZA_45`, `SZA_48.2` or `SZA_48.5`, `SZA_60`). Diurnal averaging factors are 0.354 (45°), 0.375 (48.2°), and 0.5 (60°). Typical output files per run:

- `PTZ_mixingratios_out.dist` — altitude, pressure, temperature, and species mixing ratios
- `out.O2prates` — O₂ photolysis rates
- `int.rates.out` — integrated photochemical rates

**`WACCM_PT_profiles/`** — P–T profiles extracted from WACCM6, used as input to Atmos.

**`Methane_Perturbations/`** — CH₄ lower-boundary flux varied at selected O₂ levels (`0.1pc_PT_profile`, `1pc_PT_profile`, `10pc_PT_profile`, `100pc_PT_profile`).

**`Old sims/`** — early test runs with an outdated O₃ deposition velocity; retained for reference but **not recommended for analysis**.

---

### `Photochem/`

Output from [Photochem](https://github.com/Nicholaswogan/photochem). The parameter space mirrors Atmos: WACCM6 P–T profiles, solar evolution, and boundary-condition perturbations.

**Standard grid** (`0.1pc/` … `150pc/`):  
Files are named `Earth_<O2>pc_<SZA>.txt` (e.g. `Earth_100pc_48.2.txt`). Each file contains column-integrated mixing ratios for the full chemical network (O₃, O, O₂, NOₓ, HOₓ, hydrocarbons, etc.) on a fixed altitude grid.

**`Young Sun/`** — faint young Sun simulations across the O₂ grid.

**`WACCM6_Sun_simulations/`** — runs using WACCM6 stellar spectra directly (`WACCMSun_<O2>pc_48.2.txt`).

**`Methane_Perturbations/`** — CH₄ boundary-condition sensitivity tests.

**`Albedo Perturbations/`** — surface albedo sensitivity at 0.1% and 100% PAL.

**`Proxima_Centauri/`** — Proxima Centauri b stellar input with Earth boundary conditions.

**`Old sims/`** — superseded early runs; see individual P–T profile sub-folders.

---

### `VULCAN/`

Configuration and input files for [VULCAN](https://github.com/shami-EEG/VULCAN) runs. VULCAN output files (`.vul`) are referenced in the Python analysis scripts but are not stored in this repository due to size.

**`config_files/`** — one configuration file per simulation. Naming convention:

```
cfg_Earth_<O2>pc_o2_1e12s_<SZA>SZA_WPT_1rtol.txt
```

Key settings in each config:

- `atm_file` — WACCM6 P–T and eddy-diffusion (Kzz) profile
- `sflux_file` — stellar UV spectrum (Gueymard solar or young-Sun files)
- `bot_BC_flux_file` — lower-boundary fluxes (CH₄, N₂O, etc.)
- `out_name` — corresponding `.vul` output filename

Methane perturbations are indicated in filenames (e.g. `0.01xCH4`, `10xCH4`). Water-vapour perturbations use the suffix `_0.6hum` (60% relative humidity scaling).

**`Inputs/`** — atmospheric profiles, stellar flux files, and lower-boundary condition tables shared across configs.

---

### `Kasting_1D_model/`

Output from the 1D photochemical model developed in the group headed by James Kasting ([Ji et al. 2024](https://zenodo.org/records/10822978)), which uses a correlated-*k* parameterisation for O₂ photolysis in the Schumann–Runge bands (175–205 nm).

**Standard grid** (`0.1pc/` … `150pc/`):  
Sub-folders for SZA (`SZA_45`, `SZA_48.2`, `SZA_60`) and an `8point` diurnal-integration option. Key output files:

- `outchem.dat` — chemical composition profiles
- `OUTPUT_PLOT.dat` — formatted output for plotting

**`WACCM_PT_Profiles/`** — WACCM6 P–T profiles used as input.

**`Ji 2024 fixed flux simulations with WACCM PT profiles/`** — runs with fixed lower-boundary fluxes and WACCM6 thermal structure across the full O₂ grid (0.1%–100% PAL).

**`Old sims/`** — legacy Kasting model setup files and early test output.

---

### `Python/`

Analysis and figure-generation code for the paper.

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `Early_Earth.py` | Main analysis script — loads model output, computes ozone columns, odd-oxygen budgets, and generates comparison figures. Run cell-by-cell in Spyder or as a script. |
| `early_earth_lib.py` | Shared library: I/O helpers, ozone column integrals, production/loss diagnostics, plotting utilities, and WACCM6 data readers. |

The scripts compare all four 1D models against WACCM6, including O₂–O₃ curves, catalytic loss budgets (NOₓ, HOₓ), methane and humidity perturbations, Proxima Centauri b cases, and latitude-resolved WACCM6 diagnostics.

> **Note:** Some hard-coded file paths in the Python scripts point to local WACCM6 NetCDF archives and VULCAN `.vul` output directories on the authors' machines. Update these paths before running locally.

---

### `PSG/`

Post-processing pipeline for generating synthetic planetary spectra via the [NASA Planetary Spectrum Generator (PSG)](https://psg.gsfc.nasa.gov/). The scripts convert 1D model output into PSG input files and submit them to the PSG API.

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `main.py` | Entry point — builds PSG configs and optionally uploads to PSG |
| `config.py` | Planet, star, geometry, and atmosphere file settings |
| `atmosphere.py` | Converts model output to PSG atmosphere format |
| `psg_writer.py` | Writes PSG configuration files |
| `plot_spectra.py` | Plots resulting transmission/emission spectra |

Used to assess how model and boundary-condition differences propagate into observables relevant to exoplanet characterisation.

## Key simulation suites

### Baseline O₂–O₃ grid

The core dataset spans eight O₂ levels (0.1%–150% PAL) × three solar zenith angles × four models, all using WACCM6 P–T profiles and present-day solar flux (`Sun_0.0Ga`). This grid maps the Proterozoic-to-Phanerozoic oxygenation history and forms the basis of the O₂–O₃ comparison curves in the paper.

### Faint young Sun

The `Young Sun/` (Photochem) and `Coupled Young Sun Simulations/` (Atmos) folders vary stellar age (e.g. 2.4 Ga) at low and high O₂, isolating the effect of a weaker, harder-UV young Sun on ozone production.

### Methane perturbations

CH₄ mixing ratio is scaled by factors from 0.01× to 10× present-day values. Methane affects HOₓ and odd-oxygen chemistry, particularly at low O₂, and is a major source of inter-model disagreement.

### Water vapour perturbations

Tropospheric H₂O is scaled (e.g. `_0.6hum` configs in VULCAN) to test sensitivity to atmospheric humidity, which influences UV shielding and HOₓ production.

### Surface albedo

Albedo is varied from 0.06 to 0.30 at fixed SZA to probe how surface reflectivity affects actinic flux and photolysis rates in the lower atmosphere.

### Proxima Centauri b

A parallel suite (`Proxima Centauri/` in Atmos, `Proxima_Centauri/` in Photochem) applies Earth-like boundary conditions with M-dwarf stellar flux and exoplanet P–T profiles, connecting the early-Earth work to exoplanet habitability.
